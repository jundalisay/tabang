<!-- ## Territorial disputes -->

Territorial disputes should be judged by competent international courts. 


<!-- ## Foreign Policy -->

Countries should pursue an independent foreign policy, as each issue has complex political and cultural roots. 


<!-- ## National Defense -->

National defense should be strengthened despite having alliances. 



## Sabah Claim

The government should pursue the claim of the Philippines on Sabah in international course in order to ensure the welfare of the Filipinos there.

However, if the courts side with Malaysia, the Malaysian government should guarantee the rights of the Filipinos to residence, employment, and non-discrimination as if they were true citizens of Malaysia.

Filipinos who commit crimes in Sabah should be tried by Philippine courts, in accordance to our position on cross-border justice.


## West Philippine Sea

The islands in the West Philippine Sea belonging to the Philippines' exclusive economic zone belong to the Philippines. The country should defend those islands without depending on foreign alliances, as such alliances often come with strings attached.
