The maxim "prevention is better than cure" applies both in medicine and in criminality. 

The best cure for crime is to prevent it from blossoming. 

Our proposed crime-prevention measures centers on the following:

- proper education
- livelihood 
- sports, agriculture, and environmentalism


## Proper Education

The government should teach Young people the dangers of specific drugs such as:
- marijuana
- solvents, rugby, syrup
- shabu 
<!-- - opium  -->

Liquor should only be sold in designated areas. 


## Sports, Agriculture, and Environmentalism

To give the mind something to do, the government should spend for the following programs:

- tree-planting 
- community clean-up
- agriculture 
- sports
