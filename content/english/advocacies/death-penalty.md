Death Penalty should be instituted in order to reduce crime. 

However, there should be due process. The crime should be proven without any doubt. 

We agree with the proposal of Senator Robin Padilla, [Senate Bill 2217](https://legacy.senate.gov.ph/lisdata/4171538000!.pdf), that adds the death penalty to the Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.
