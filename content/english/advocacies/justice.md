In the current system, local disagreements are merely recorded by the police. It is up to the parties involved to escalate the dispute to the courts. 

This overburdens the justice system and makes justice slow. 


## Increased Role of the Barangay

The community, through the barangay, should play a bigger role in justice system.  

The police should refer immedate and simple disputes to the barangay which will be then deputized to decide on the issue, which will then be implemented by the local police.  

For example, traffic altercations should be resolved by the barangay instead of being raised to courts. 

This advocacy will likely be opposed by lawyers as it would reduce the number of lawsuits and therefore reduce the need for lawyers.
