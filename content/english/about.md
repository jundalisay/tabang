The Alsa Masa, also known as "Masang Dabaw," was a vigilante group that emerged in Davao City, Philippines, in late 1986. 

{{< button "Read Our Short History Here" "/feature/23-04-08/" >}}

The group was formed by seven individuals, including a young boy named Roque Remo, the son of the founder. Roque Remo was appointed as a guardian overseeing the activities and meetings of Alsa Masa. It was formed in response to the oppression of the communist New People's Army (NPA), and they targeted and killed innocent civilians in Davao City.

The civilian members of Alsa Masa were determined to counter the abuses committed by the communist NPA rebels and actively sought opportunities to fight against the NPA. The conflict against the NPA began on April 8, 1986, when Alsa Masa launched an uprising, targeting and killing a commander affiliated with the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), NPA, and NDF. 

This act aimed to show the NPA that Alsa Masa was willing to fight back. The NPA became fearful of Alsa Masa and, as a result, both sides experienced casualties in the prolonged conflict.

During that time, Davao City faced numerous challenges, including high crime rates, drug-related activities, and the presence of communist rebels from the NPA. Many residents felt unsafe and frustrated with the perceived lack of capability of the local government and law enforcement agencies to address these issues.

Alsa Masa, which translates to "Rise, Masses" in English, was organized as a civilian group aiming to combat crime and maintain peace and order in the city. The group gained support from various sectors, including business owners, religious leaders, and ordinary citizens.

Under the leadership of Romeo Remo Sr., the founder of Alsa Masa in Davao City, the group staunchly opposed criminality and communism without compromise. They organized citizen patrols and encouraged residents to be vigilant in reporting suspicious activities. Alsa Masa actively campaigned against communist terrorism, illegal drugs, criminality, prostitution, and other social ills.

While the group garnered support for its actions, there were also criticisms and allegations of human rights abuses. Some claimed that Alsa Masa engaged in extrajudicial killings and other forms of violence against suspected criminals and rebels. However, these allegations were often challenging to conclusively prove.

It is important to note that the history of Alsa Masa in Davao City is a complex and controversial subject, with different perspectives and accounts. The existence and actions of the group reflect a specific period in the city's history, characterized by the challenges and concerns faced by its residents at that time.
